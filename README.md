Udacity iOS Nanodegree Pitch Perfect app

Part of my coursework towards the iOS Nanodegree.

Project 1 of my coursework for the Udacity iOS Nanodegree.

This is an introductory project designed to get the student used to working with Xcode, Cocoa Touch and Swift. It uses basic view controllers and the AVFoundation library to modify user recorded sounds.
